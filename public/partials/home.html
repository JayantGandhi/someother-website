    <p>This is my very own <em>personalized</em> site. Here I can put all the different things I have been working on. It might be a bit eccletic, but then so am I. Hopefully it's easy enough to find exactly what you are looking for without too much trouble.</p>
    <p>If you like what you see here please feel free to contact <a href="mailto:jayant.gandhi127@gmail.com">me</a>. I ususally respond pretty quickly to emails and I'm always looking for a cool new project to sink my teeth into. So please explore some other website and get to know a little bit more about me.</p>
